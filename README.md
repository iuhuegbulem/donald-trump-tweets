# Exploring Donald Trump's tweets
On January 8, 2021, Twitter suspended the account of former U.S President, Donald J. Trump for allegedly inciting violence and breaking their rules. This ban received a lot of mixed reviews from both Twitter and non-Twitter users all over the world.

The purpose of this shiny application is to analyze all purported negative tweets by Donald Trump from when he announced his candidacy in 2015 to 2021 when he was banned from Twitter. This project was inspired by this New York Times article https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/19/upshot/trump-complete-insult-list.html and the dataset used was gotten from https://www.kaggle.com/ayushggarg/all-trumps-twitter-insults-20152021.
